This plugin enables custom post types directly to add page templates of the page type.

== Description ==

The Custom Post Type Page Template plugin enables custom post types directly to add page templates of the page type.

It is unavailable to use page templates of the page type in other post types by default. Most of themes have original page templates of the page type as part of themes. Twenty Eleven also has two page templates. It is convenient directly to use page templates in custom post types except the page type, isn't it?
